The TopicForm can be used for a wide range of TopicTypes that only need to be marked
as being of a given TopicType.
If you need more structure then you have to define a specific DataForm that 
extends the DataFormAttributes of this form. That is the attributes defined here
are a minimal set of attributes that all DataForms should have. 

Every TopicType is used in combination with one DataForm, that is associated with it,
either this generic TopicForm or a more specific one. 
Multiple TopicTypes can share the same DataForm. In this case such a DataForm must allow to select from a set of TopicTypes to mark it properly. 
Very often there is one TopicType for one DataForm.
Note, that a topic can be of several TopicTypes which indicates that it fullfills several
duties at once, that is the associated DataForm contains the attributes of a couple 
of DataForms.
